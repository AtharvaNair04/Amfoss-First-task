copy.copy() is a shallow copy of the list. It copies the refernce to the objects stored in the original.
copy.deepcopy() is a deep copy of the list , i.e it copies all objects found in the list. This results in a complete independent copy where changes to the original copy will not affect the deep copy and vice versa.
